This is a very simple test for the [htmx](https://htmx.org) frontend library.

Basically, all of the data in the `src/data` directory is turned into static html files in the `public/data` directory.
The `public/index.html` file is the entry point, which contains an htmx attribute that loads the index frame.

The web templates (in `src/templates.mjs`) use the [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev) component library for Tailwind, while
all of the data were written by ChatGPT. The images were taken from [Unsplash](unsplash.com/).
